Harnessing the power of the worst practices around

## Untestable

Randomly placed timeouts and randomly generated CSS class names ensure zero testability.

## Undebugable

An inaccessible shadow dom and misleading error messages make debugging close to impossible task.

## Worst developer experience

No directory structure, wrong intellisense suggestions and no documentation guarantee your dev team has a hard time.

## Asynchronous hell

Everything - even variable initialization - is asynchronous. Promise support? Hell no!

## Unstable

Everything LEAD.js is buggy as hell and we guarantee to introduce more bugs with every release.

## Worst performance

We invented JS maxify to ensure an overly large bundle size and every dom change triggers a complete rerender of the whole application.

# Go the unneccessary extra mile - with LEAD.js
